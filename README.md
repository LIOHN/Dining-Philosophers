##Dining philosophers problem with a twist:
Implementation of a variation of the Dining Philosophers problem. EIGHT COPYISTS are employed by to make diï¬€erent scale accurate reproductions of various technical drawings, e.g. architectural blueprints. After completing a task, the copyist checks it against the original, and if satisfied with the work done, the copyist moves onto the next task. Since the firm is rather impoverished, it has only been able to provide FOUR EIDOGRAPHS and FOUR PENCILS. As a result these must be shared between the eight. A copyist, however, cannot carry out any task unless he/she is able to use both simultaneously. 

##Minimum Swaps exercise:
Given an unordered list consisting of consecutive integers  [1, 2, 3, ..., n] (where n is the number of elements) without any duplicates, find the minimum amount of swaps          necessary to sort the list in ascending order. Only two elements are allowed per swap.
