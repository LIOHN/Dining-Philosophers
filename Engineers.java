/**
* Implementation of a variation of the Dining Philosophers problem. EIGHT COPYISTS are employed by
* to make diï¬€erent scale accurate reproductions of various technical drawings, e.g. architectural
* blueprints. After completing a task, the copyist checks it against the original, and if satisfied
* with the work done, the copyist moves onto the next task. Since the firm is rather impoverished,
* it has only been able to provide FOUR EIDOGRAPHS and FOUR PENCILS. As a result these must be 
* shared between the eight. A copyist, however, cannot carry out any task unless he/she is able to
* use both simultaneously. 
* Class Engineers contains the main method and initialises the 8 copyists, their respective threads
* and the tools.
* Shared resources are pencils and eidographs. The use of keyword "synchronised" makes this program
* thread-safe. Callbacks with lock held may occur but a thread is asked to wait AND sleep if 
* a tool is unavailable.
